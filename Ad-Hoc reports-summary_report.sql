-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?
/*-Between 2002 and 2016 there was a significant growth in each year's membership count, for 2017 this number seems to be leveling of thanks to the missing data from
november and december.
-There seems to be missing data from december 2017, as there are only joined dates until the 2nd of december, 2017, the rest of the month is missing.
-Also there is missing data between the 9th and 20th and between 24th and 30th of November.
-There is no significant difference in each city's membership growth, they are all leveling of the same ratio.*/

-- 3. What five groups should marketing feature in their upcoming campaign?*
/*Based on the data it is advised to feature the following 5.0 rating groups in the upcoming campaign:

New York

NYC Local Singles and Professional Get Together (category: 10) with 5776 members, the second most of all.
